################## Read in the d1 (accelerometer burst) data ###################

## turn the data table into a dataframe
d1 <- as.data.frame( d1 )


d1$tag <- d1$individual_local_identifier

## turn timestamp - UTC - POSIX element and time into character
## some of the timestamps are not exactly on the minute because the burst occurred late. Round the timestamps to the nearest minute
d1$flr_local_timestamp <- floor_date( d1$local_timestamp, unit = 'min' )
#d1$timestamp <- as.POSIXct( d1$flr_local_timestamp, tz = 'UTC' )
d1$timestamp <- d1$flr_local_timestamp

## make a column for the time of the burst
d1$time <- str_split_fixed(d1$timestamp, " ", 2)[,2]

## make a column for local time
d1$local_time <- str_split_fixed(d1$local_timestamp, " ", 2)[,2]

## view the dataframe and it's summary

time_shift <- d1$local_timestamp - 12*60*60

## save the date of the first night of the study (the date of the night is always the date of the evening at the beginning of that night; so the first night of the study is 2012-07-31, although the data starts on 2012-08-01, because the data on that first morning is still technically part of the data for the previous night, as a night is noon to noon)

time_gap <- 20*60 ## this is the maximum allowable time gap between two accelerometer bursts (in seconds) that can exist in a noon-to-noon period without removing this noon-to-noon period from the data

mov_window <- 9 ## this is the size of the moving window (in minutes) used in calculating the rolling median of the average VeDBA

block_size <- 30 ## duration in minutes of the blocks of continuous inactivity that will be considered sleep

gap_size <- 45 ## maximum duration between sleep blocks that will be merged

percentile_for_no_mult <- 0.90 # this is the percentile threshold of the log VeDBA within the 18:00 to 06:30 period used to classify activity vs. inactivity (without multiplying by a multiplier)

waso_block <- 3 ## this is the number of consecutive minutes of inactivity needed to classify a period as sleep. A waso_block of 1 means that anytime the value is below the threshold, the baboon in considered sleeping and anytime the value is above the threshold the baboon is considered awake

frag_block <- 2 ## this is the number of minutes of waking that need to be consecutive to be considered a wake bout during the night (other epochs of wake that do not meet this criterion will still be considered wake for WASO and wake_bouts, but not frag_wake_bouts)

# Define the coordinates for Mpala Research Centre

#dark_start <- '19:55:00' # the time at which evening astronomical twilight ends (or whatever time you want to use to consider the start of 'night')
#dark_end <- '05:23:00' # the time at which morning astronomical twilight starts (or whatever time you want to use to consider the end of 'night')

## shows the time (as well as one previous time and one later time) where a minute is skipped. This shows that throughout the data, a burst at every minute is represented
#sort( unique( d1$time ) ) [ which( diff( as_hms( sort( unique( d1$time ) ) ) ) != as_hms( '00:01:00' ) ) + -1:1 ]
